What Are Polynomials?

What's a term?
-a mathematical expression that's made up of two different parts, a number and a variable multiplied together
What's a coefficient?
-the number part of a term
True or false. The variable part of a term can be one or more variables raised to a power.
What's a polynomial?
-a combination of many terms connected with addition or subtraction
What's a monomial?
-a polynomial with one term
What's a binomial?
-has two terms
What's a trinomial?
-has three terms
How many terms does the polynomial 4x² + x + 2 have?
-three
What is a constant term?
-a term with no variable (always stays the same)
True or false. The degree of a term is determined by the power of the variable part.
-true
True or false. 4x² is a second degree term.
-true
True or false. x is a first degree term.
-true
Why do we care about the degree of terms?
-to help decide the arrangement of the polynomial
Arrange the polynomial 3x³ + 4 + 2x + 6x² + 5x⁴ from highest to lowest degree.
-5x(4) + 3x(3) + 6x(2) + 4
Arrange the polynomial 2x + 4x³ - 2x⁶ from highest to lowest degree.
-2x(6) + (4x3) + 2x
Simplifying Polynomials

How do you simply a polynomial?
Simplify the polynomial x³ + x² + x² + x¹.
What are like terms?
True or false: 3x² and x² are like terms.
True or false: x³ and y³ are like terms.
True or false: -5x and 4x are like terms.
Simplify the polynomial -5x + 4x.
True or false: 2x² and 2x³ are like terms.
True or false: -3xy and 6yx are like terms.
Simplify the polynomial -3xy + 6yx.
True or false: 5x²y and 3yx² are like terms.
Simplify the polynomial 2x³ + 3x - x³ + 5.
Simplify the polynomial 4x² - 5 + x² + 11.
Simplify the polynomial -x + 1 - 7x² + 3x - 6 - 2x².
